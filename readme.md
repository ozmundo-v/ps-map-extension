Boardmaster Helper Chrome Extension

##Introduction
The Boardmaster helper is a simplified version of the main monitoring page which checks every minute for updates.
The total number of releases with build/test failures is displayed as a numbered icon. Clicking on the icon opens a
popup with a clickable list of releases.

This is still WIP, so contact Oz with bugs or suggestions. 
 

## Setup
Go to Settings > More Tools > Extensions in Chrome

Choose 'Load Unpacked' and select the folder for the extension. This will add the extension to Chrome, but you still need to pin it to see the summary icon. 
You can do this by clicking on the extensions toolbar button and then selecting pin for boardmaster.

##Options
Right click on the toolbar button and choose options.

Currently, the only option is to add a list of keywords as comma-separated text values (no spaces). These keywords will be 
used to highlight repos in red.
